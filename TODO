TODO:

CRITICAL:

MINOR:
	
	- write detailed error messages for file opening
	- outsource parts of "Tileset" to "TilesetArea"
	- fine tune gcc include dirs for each .c file (to speed up compilation)
	- make many parts of the app independent of GlobalData header
	  (make them return data instead of attaching it to gdata themselves)
	- create app icon
	
EXPERIMENTAL:

	- allow filling buffers with defaultvalue when tileset source
	  has expanded horizontally
	- add gif and jpeg support through gdk (j4f)
	
	- Add some humble license to the top of every source file =)
