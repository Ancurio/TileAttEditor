TODO:

	- when tileset image cannot be found, allow user to search for it
	- have the config file be written to some fixed location
	- make KEY_TO_VALUE macros function like (require ';')
	- write prototypes for static functions
	- outsource parts of "Tileset" to "TilesetArea"
	- save window size to settings and restore on next startup
	- fine tune gcc include dirs for each .c file (to speed up compilation)
	- make KEY_TO_VALUE macros own variables on heap
	- write detailed error messages for file opening
	- make statusbar respond to filemenu actions
	- have documents dropped into the tileset area be opened
	- have window title indicate open file path/name
	- closing of app should prompt "save changes" dialog
	- add const to gchar* parameters where neccessary
	- have the last opened file be saved in config, and reopen on restart
	- make many parts of the app independent of GlobalData header
	  (make them return data instead of attaching it to gdata themselves)
	- files should only be closed at the very last moment:
	  write function to take over checking files from file_parse
	
	- Add some humble license to the top of every source file =)
