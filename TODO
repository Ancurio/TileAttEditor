TODO:

CRITICAL:

	- make statusbar respond to filemenu actions
	- have documents dropped into the tileset area be opened
	- have png files dropped open up new-file-dialog with them selected

MINOR:

	- when tileset image cannot be found, allow user to search for it
	- make KEY_TO_VALUE macros function like (require ';')
	- write prototypes for static functions
	- outsource parts of "Tileset" to "TilesetArea"
	- fine tune gcc include dirs for each .c file (to speed up compilation)
	- make KEY_TO_VALUE macros own variables on heap
	- write detailed error messages for file opening
	- have window title indicate open file path/name
	- add const to gchar* parameters where neccessary
	- make many parts of the app independent of GlobalData header
	  (make them return data instead of attaching it to gdata themselves)
	- maybe make function prototypes in headers more uniform..
	- create app icon
	- have the attribute buttons contain icons
	
	- add gif and jpeg support through gdk (j4f)
	
	- Add some humble license to the top of every source file =)
